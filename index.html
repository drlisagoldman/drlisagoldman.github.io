		<p> If you are experiencing emotional pain from a past or current relationship, I provide a supportive, non-judgmental atmosphere in which you can gain insight and feel empowered to make positive life changes. As a Clinical Psychologist with over 20 years experience, I have specialized in addressing interpersonal issues, life transitions and in treating depression and anxiety. In individual or couples therapy, we will explore ways of thinking and patterns of interaction that are no longer working for you. Therapy aims to promote both healing and growth for individuals, and to enhance communication, connection and trust within one's relationships. 
		</p>
		<p> For individual therapy, I integrate Cognitive-Behavioral and Psychodynamic approaches. For couples therapy, I apply Gottman research findings. In addition, I have extensive experience working with pre-marital issues, communication problems and infidelity recovery. Because privacy/confidentiality are concerns of many individuals and couples, I offer a private waiting room.
		</p> 
		<p> I enjoy working with adults of all ages, from college students to older adults. Having served as Clinical Geropsychologist at the Manhattan VA Medical Center prior to opening my Private Practice, I have also worked with patients suffering from dementia, medical issues and loss.
